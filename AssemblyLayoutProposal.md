#This is a proposal for the way we will layout the download

# The Assembly #

The Assembly is the thing that users will be able to download. It will have the jars, docs etc so that people can download something and then be able to run with it.

# Details #

  * 4 directories
    * src - source jars
    * lib - krank jar files
    * samples - krank sample war files
    * docs - javadocs for krank
  * Files
    * LICENSE.txt - the license text
    * README.txt - quick what is Krank

= Assumptions -

  * None of the testing stuff is required by users
